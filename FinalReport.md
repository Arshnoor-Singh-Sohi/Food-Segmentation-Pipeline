### 6.2 Performance Challenge: Training Metrics vs. Real Performance

**Problem Identification:**
Local model training achieved impressive validation metrics (98% mAP50) but completely failed real-world testing, revealing the danger of optimizing for training metrics rather than practical performance.

**Analysis and Understanding:**
Deep investigation revealed that the model was learning to match artificially generated training labels rather than learning to detect actual objects in real images. This insight highlighted the critical importance of training data quality over training data quantity.

**Validation Framework Development:**
In response to this challenge, the team developed comprehensive ground truth validation procedures that measure actual system performance against manual counting baselines, providing honest assessment rather than optimistic assumptions.
